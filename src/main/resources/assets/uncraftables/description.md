What does this mod do?
==================
A lot of Vanilla Minecraft items are uncraftable and some of them can only obtained via grinding or luck or once. I want to change this, but I'm a big fan of balancing, so these items are still relatively hard to obtain in my opinion, even with this mod. If not make it hard, we may just play in Creative mode, right?

List of recipes
------------------
* Chains [^1]

* Chainmail Boots

* Chainmail Chestplate

* Chainmail Helmet

* Chainmail Leggings

* Crying Obsidian

* Diamond Horse Armor

* Golden Horse Armor

* Iron Horse Armor

* Leather [^2]

* Saddle

* String [^3]

All crafting recipes can be found in the JAR under assets. They will also be added to your Recipe Book when you get hold of the appropriate ingredients.

[^1]: There is already a recipe for Chains, but I have edited it to just requiring Iron Nuggets.

[^2]: Saddles are not stackable by default and I just got so many from fishing, so I added a recipe to turn it into leather while I was at it, even though Leather is already craftable.

[^3]: String can be crafted from cobwebs but on Bedrock Edition. This adds that recipe to the Java Edition.

I have overridden an original recipe so it is properly grouped in the Recipe Book. This might do some problems if you use other mods changing that recipe. If you encounter problems, drop a comment or file an issue :-)

Modpacks
==================
Go ahead, just list me as author of this mod in your mod list (CC-BY-4.0 license and all that). If you want to give me extra pleasure, notify me in the comments if you included this mod in your modpack.

Ports
==================
I will do no forge ports, but come on, these are just crafting recipes! This is basically the easiest modding you can do! Try it! (And if you copy my recipes, it would be very nice of you to name me as the one with the initial recipe idea. I took some time thinking of it, after all!)
But if you want a fabric port to older versions, I might do it if you ask me to in the comments; suggestions for the netherite ingot replacements for version 14 and 15 are welcome.
